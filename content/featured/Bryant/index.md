Utilized immunohistochemistry, confocal microscopy, and Sholl analysis to quantify microglial morphology changes in the PVN of mice. Conducted Î±-SMA and Trichrome staining to visualize lung vascular remodeling. Performed flow cytometry to measure infiltration of immune cells in various regions of mouse lung and brain. Presented <a href="https://doi.org/10.1152/physiol.2024.39.S1.2611" target="_blank"> first-author abstract</a> at APS 2024, suggesting that targeted microglia activation significantly increases RVSP.
