Utilized immunostaining, confocal imaging, and Sholl analysis to quantify key disease-induced changes in microglia morphology. Conducted α-SMA and Trichrome stainings to visualize smooth muscle cell proliferation and collagen deposition in mouse lung. Performed flow cytometry to measure the infiltration of immune cells in different regions of the lungs and brain in diseased mice.
