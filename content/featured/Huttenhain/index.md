Generated human iPSC-derived neurons and implemented mass spectrometry to analyze proteomic changes during maturation. Expressed West Nile virus proteins in iPSC-derived neurons and performed affinity purification to detect host-virus interactions. Cloned tagged viral proteins and transfected A549 cells to validate viral protein expression and subcellular localization. Received <a href="https://biosciences.stanford.edu/pathways/ssrp-amgen-scholars-program/" target="_blank"> oral presentation award</a> at SSRP-Amgen symposium.
