Differentiate human iPSCs into cortical neurons and use mass spectrometry to analyze proteomic changes during maturation. Express West Nile Virus proteins in iPSC-derived neurons and perform AP-MS to identify host-virus interactions in neurons. Clone tagged viral proteins and transfect human neuroblastoma cells to characterize host protein interactions using AP-MS.
