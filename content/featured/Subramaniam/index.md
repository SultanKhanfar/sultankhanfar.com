Performed patch clamp electrophysiology to compare the electrical properties of healthy and diseased primary cortical neurons. Conducted co-immunoprecipitation to quantify Rhes and Tau protein binding inside nanotube-like projections connecting neurons. Transduced primary neuron cultures with adeno-associated viruses and used confocal microscopy to examine Rhes and Tau protein transport between neurons.
