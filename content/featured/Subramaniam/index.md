Transfected and live-imaged microglia co-cultures to examine Rhes-mediated mutant Huntingtin protein transport. Infected primary neurons with adeno-associated viruses and applied confocal imaging to capture protein transport along nanotubes. Performed co-IP and western blotting to quantify Rhes and Tau protein binding inside nanotubes connecting striatal neurons.
