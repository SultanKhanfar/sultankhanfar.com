Identified through transfections and live imaging that microglia transfer Tau and mutant Huntingtin using tunneling nanotubes. Transduced primary neurons with adeno-associated viruses and used confocal microscopy to visualize protein transport through nanotubes. Performed co-IP and western blot to show that Rhes binds to mutant Huntingtin to facilitate its spread between cells.
