Developed an in vitro electroshock assay to study the effects of Resveramorph-3 (RVM-3) on seizure-like activity. Demonstrated that RVM-3 exhibits effective anti-seizure activity at picomolar concentrations. Became 1 of just 3 students from Suncoast High School to receive the maximum score on the 2023 AP Research Exam, which included a <a href="/apresearch.pdf" target="_blank">5,000-word paper</a> and a 20-minute talk.
