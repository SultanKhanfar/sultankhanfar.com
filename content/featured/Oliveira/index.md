Combine IHC and RNAscope to study microglial modulation of synaptic plasticity in autonomic brain regions of mice. Perform immunofluorescence stainings to investigate pulmonary artery apoptosis and lung vascular remodeling. Utilize high-resolution confocal microscopy and Imaris to quantify notable changes in microglia morphology and investigate neuron-glia interactions.
