Apply multiplex RNAscope to localize microglia and therapeutic targets such as TREM2 and C1q in the PVN of the mouse brain. Conduct immunofluorescence staining to investigate pulmonary artery apoptosis and lung vascular remodeling. Utilize confocal microscopy and Imaris to quantify disease-induced changes in microglia morphology and investigate neuron-glia interactions.
