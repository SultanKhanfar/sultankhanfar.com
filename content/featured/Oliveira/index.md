Apply multiplex RNAscope and immunohistochemistry staining to localize microglia and therapeutic targets in the mouse brain. Conduct immunofluorescence staining to investigate pulmonary artery apoptosis and lung vascular remodeling. Utilize confocal microscopy and Imaris to quantify disease-induced changes in microglia morphology and investigate neuron-glia interactions.
